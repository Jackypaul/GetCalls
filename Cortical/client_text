The goal of the project is, for the integration of high-shares of non-dispatchable renewables, to foster the cost-efficient roll-out of flexibility solutions required for energy markets, for existing and future system services and for the dynamic control of grid flow. Flexibility solutions include storage, flexible renewablegeneration, demand response as well as power elecronics (FACTS for instance).
Large demonstrations will help test the different flexibility solutions, with a focus on synergies.  The techno-economic feasibility will be assessed for each demonstation.
If necessary evolutions of market designs and regulations will be proposed.
