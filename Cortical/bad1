The challenge is to develop a safe and sustainable battery for electric-vehicles through the development of new materials and chemistries making use of abundant, sustainable low cost materials, which are easily available in Europe. Solutions are required to provide the same or better performance than vehicles with internal combustion engines and to be capable of recharging the electric vehicle within a time equivalent to fill a conventional gasoline/diesel fuel tank.

This prize will contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of Europe for the benefit of the EU's economy and its citizens.

This prize has been set-up to:

    Foster knowledge, innovation and competitiveness in e-vehicle battery/ energy storage technologies.
    Enhance the European manufacturing base for e-vehicle batteries.
    Strengthen the European Industrial value chain (e.g. through exploitation or synergies with existing European industrial infrastructures).
    Strengthen European value added in the supply and knowledge of advanced materials and chemistries for batteries.
    Encourage electro-mobility, opening up new markets and incentivising technological innovations.
    Enhance employment prospects along the entire electro-mobility value chain.
    Contribute to a significant drop in CO2 and NOx emissions in line with global environmental policies.

The specific rules of the contest will be published in the fourth quarter of 2017 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.
