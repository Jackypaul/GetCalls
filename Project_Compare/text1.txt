Virtual power plant" offer, consisting of the aggregation of distributed resources (photovoltaic production, heat pumps, inertia heating, EV charging terminals, storage batteries, etc.) that allows..:
	efficient and scalable management of electrical erasure capabilities
         to promote self-consumption
         to be present on the trading markets (capacity, intraday...)
         to respond to "network" needs and constraints.
     Portfolio of applications aimed at traditional electricity distributors, energy service companies, etc.
     Applicatives enabling their users to understand how their energy resources are used, or even optimised, and to participate in an energy community made up of the pooling of production sources and consumption needs
     Innovative management of tertiary or complex real estate buildings by introducing contractual management concepts such as "SLA management" which make it possible to support network balance exchanges within the managed community
     Ability to connect heterogeneous physical devices and absorb, process large amounts of information
     Internally developed IoT platform
     Optimisation of the efficiency of the elements connected to the platform by drawing up optimised operating schedules
     Algorithmic skills and integration of external information sources 
     Solutions deployed on the German market with companies such as Beegy and municipalities such as Stadtwerke Stuttgart
     Tests by British Gas or The Mobility House
     Current work with Energias de Portugal and suppliers of photovoltaic and heating solutions
